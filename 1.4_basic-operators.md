# Basic operators
Operators are symbols that perform specific actions on one or more operands. In JavaScript, there are several types of operators that you can use to manipulate data and control the flow of your program.

## Assignment operators

Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable. The most basic assignment operator is the equal sign (=), which assigns a value to a variable. For example:

```javascript
var message = "Hello, world!";
```

There are also compound assignment operators, which combine a math operation with an assignment. For example:

```javascript
var x = 10;
x += 5; // x is now 15
x -= 5; // x is now 10
x *= 2; // x is now 20
x /= 2; // x is now 10
```

## Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic math operations. The basic arithmetic operators are `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), and `/` (division). For example:

```javascript
var x = 10;
var y = 5;

console.log(x + y); // 15
console.log(x - y); // 5
console.log(x * y); // 50
console.log(x / y); // 2
```

There are also other arithmetic operators, such as the `%` (modulus) operator, which returns the remainder of a division operation. For example:

```javascript
console.log(10 % 3); // 1
console.log(11 % 3); // 2
```

## Comparison operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean value (`true` or `false`). The basic comparison operators are `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), and `<=` (less than or equal to). For example:


```javascript
console.log(5 == 5);    // true
console.log(5 == "5");  // true
console.log(5 === "5"); // false
console.log(5 != 5);    // false
console.log(5 > 5);     // false
console.log(5 < 5);     // false
console.log(5 >= 5);    // true
console.log(5 <= 5);    // true
```

Note that the `==` operator performs type coercion, which means it converts the operands to the same type before comparison. The `===` operator, on the other hand, does not perform type coercion and only returns `true` if the operands are of the same type and value.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have covered some of the basic operators that are used in JavaScript. These operators allow you to assign values to variables, perform math operations, and compare values. Understanding how these operators work is essential for writing and working with JavaScript code.
