# Functions

Functions are blocks of code that can be defined and called by name. In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be treated like any other data type. You can assign functions to variables, pass them as arguments to other functions, and return them from functions.

## Defining functions

There are two ways to define functions in JavaScript: function declarations and function expressions.

### Function declarations

Function declarations are written using the `function` keyword followed by the name of the function and a pair of parentheses that may contain parameters. The function body is enclosed in curly braces. For example:

```js
function greet(name) {
	console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

Function declarations are hoisted, which means they are available to be called anywhere in the code, even before they are defined.

### Function expressions

Function expressions are similar to function declarations, but they are written as a part of an expression. There are two types of function expressions: anonymous function expressions and named function expressions.

#### Anonymous function expressions

Anonymous function expressions are written as a function without a name. They are usually assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to another function. For example:

```js
var greet = function(name) {
	console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
};
```

#### Named function expressions

Named function expressions are written as a function with a name, but the name is not available outside the function. They are usually used to improve the stack trace in error messages. For example:

```js
var greet = function greet(name) {
	console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
};
```

## Calling functions

To call a function, you use the name of the function followed by a pair of parentheses that may contain arguments. For example:

```js
greet("John") // "Hello, John!"
```

If a function takes no arguments, you can omit the parentheses. For example:

```js
function sayHello() {
	console.log("Hello, world!");
}

sayHello(); // "Hello, world!"
```

## Return values

Functions can return a value to the caller using the `return` statement. For example:

```js
function add(x, y) {
	return x + y;
}

console.log(add(1,2)) // 3
```

If a function does not return a value, it implicitly returns the `undefined` value.

## Function scope

In JavaScript, variables defined inside a function are only available inside that function. This is called function scope. For example:

```js
function greet(name){
	var message = "Hello, " + name + "!";
	console.log(message);
}

console.log(message) // ReferenceError: message is not defined
```

You can access variables defined in the global scope (outside of any function) from inside a function. However, you should be careful not to modify global variables accidentally, as this can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Closures

A closure is a function that has access to the variables in its outer scope, even after the outer function has returned. Closures are created when a function is defined inside another function and the inner function references a variable from the outer function.

For example:

Copy code

`function greet(name) {   var message = "Hello, " + name + "!";   return function() {     console.log(message);   }; }  var sayHello = greet("John"); sayHello(); // "Hello, John!"`
```js
function greet(name) {
	var message = "Hello, " + name + "!";
	return function() {
		console.log(message);
	}
}

var sayHello = greet("John");
sayHello() // "Hello, John!"
```

In this example, the `sayHello` function is a closure that has access to the `message` variable defined in the `greet` function.

Closures are often used to create private variables in JavaScript. By returning a function that has access to the private variables, you can create a way to access and modify the variables without exposing them directly.

In this article, we have covered the basics of functions in JavaScript. Functions are a powerful and essential tool for writing and organizing code, and understanding how they work is essential for working with JavaScript.
