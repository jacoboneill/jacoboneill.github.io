# Basic syntax and data types (e.g. variables, strings, numbers, booleans)
JavaScript is a programming language that is used to build interactive and dynamic web applications. In this article, we will explore some of the basic syntax and data types that are used in JavaScript.

## Variables

Variables are used to store and manipulate data in JavaScript. To create a variable, you use the `var` keyword followed by the name of the variable. For example:

```javascript
var message;
```

You can also assign a value to a variable when you declare it:

``` javascript
var message = 'Hello, world!'
```

In modern versions of JavaScript, you can also use the `let` or `const` keywords to declare variables. The `let` keyword creates a mutable variable, which means you can change its value later. The `const` keyword creates an immutable variable, which means you cannot change its value once it is assigned.

## Data types

JavaScript has a few basic data types that are used to represent different kinds of data. These data types include:

-   **Strings**: Strings are used to represent text. They are written as a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. For example: `"Hello, world!"`
    
-   **Numbers**: Numbers are used to represent numeric values. They can be integers (whole numbers) or floating-point numbers (decimals). For example: `42` or `3.14159`
    
-   **Booleans**: Booleans are used to represent true or false values. They are written as `true` or `false`.
    
-   **Null**: The null data type represents a null or empty value. It is written as `null`.
    
-   **Undefined**: The undefined data type represents a value that has not been assigned. It is written as `undefined`.
    

## Basic syntax

In addition to data types, there are a few basic syntax rules that you should be familiar with when working with JavaScript. These include:

-   Statements are terminated with a semicolon (`;`)
-   Blocks of code are enclosed in curly braces (`{}`)
-   Comments are written with two slashes (`//`)

For example:

```javascript
// This is a comment

var message = "Hello, world!"; // This is a statement

if(message === "Hello, world!") {
	// This is a block of code
	console.log("The message is correct!")
}
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we have covered some of the basic syntax and data types used in JavaScript. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing and working with JavaScript code. With these foundations in place, you are ready to start exploring more advanced concepts and building interactive and dynamic web applications.
