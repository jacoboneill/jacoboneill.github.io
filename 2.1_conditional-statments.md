# Conditional Statments

Conditional statements are used to execute code based on a certain condition. In JavaScript, there are several types of conditional statements that you can use to control the flow of your program.

## `if` statements

The `if` statement is the most basic conditional statement in JavaScript. It allows you to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met. For example:

```javascript
var x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
	console.log("x is greater than 5");
}
```

In this example, the code inside the curly braces will be executed if the condition `x > 5` is true.

You can also use the `else` keyword to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false:

``` javascript
var x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
	console.log("x is greater than 5");
} else {
	console.log("x is not greater than 5");
}
```

## `switch` statements

The `switch` statement allows you to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable. It is often used as an alternative to a series of `if` statements. For example:

``` javascript
var x = "apple";

switch(x) {
	case "apple":
		console.log("x is an apple");
		break;
	case "banana":
		console.log("x is a banana");
		break;
	default:
		console.log("x is neither an apple nor a banana");
		break;
}
```

In this example, the code inside the `case "apple"` block will be executed because the value of `x` is "apple". The `break` statement is used to exit the `switch` statement and prevent further execution. The `default` case is used to specify a block of code to be executed if no other cases match the value of `x`.

## `ternary` operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand way to write a simple `if` statement. It has the following syntax:

```javascript
conditon ? expression1 : expression2
```

If the condition is true, the operator returns `expression1`. If the condition is false, it returns `expression2`. For example:

``` javascript
var x = 10;

var y = (x > 5) ? "x is greater than 5" : "x is not greater than 5";

console.log(y) // "x is greater than 5"
```

This is equivalent to the following `if` statement:

``` js
var x = 10;

var y;
if (x > 5) {
	y = "x is greater than 5";
} else {
	y = "x is not greater than 5";
}

console.log(y) // "x is greater than 5"
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we have covered some of the basic conditional statements that are used in JavaScript. These statements allow you to control the flow of your program and execute code based on certain conditions. Understanding how these statements work is essential for writing and working with JavaScript code.
